Banking System Program Documentation
Overview
The Banking System Program is a console-based application written in C programming language. It allows users to perform basic banking operations such as creating accounts, checking account details, depositing money, and withdrawing money.

Features
Create Account:

Users can create a new bank account by providing their name.
The program auto-generates a unique account number for each new account.
The initial account balance is set to $0.0.
Display Account Details:

Users can view the details of a specific bank account by entering the account number.
Account details include the account number, account holder's name, and the current account balance.
Deposit Money:

Account holders can deposit money into their accounts by specifying the deposit amount.
The program ensures that the deposit amount is positive.
Withdraw Money:

Account holders can withdraw money from their accounts by specifying the withdrawal amount.
The program checks for a valid withdrawal amount and ensures that it does not exceed the account balance.
Exit:

Users can exit the program at any time.
Implementation Details
Data Structure
The program uses a simple array of structures to store bank account information.

c
Copy code
struct BankAccount {
    int accountNumber;
    char name[50];
    float balance;
};

struct BankAccount accounts[MAX_ACCOUNTS];
Functions
findAccount(int accountNumber):

Finds an account by its account number and returns the index if found, otherwise returns -1.
createAccount():

Creates a new bank account and increments the total number of accounts if the maximum limit is not reached.
displayAccountDetails(int accountIndex):

Displays the details of a specific bank account based on the provided account index.
deposit(int accountIndex):

Allows the user to deposit money into their account, updating the account balance accordingly.
withdraw(int accountIndex):

Allows the user to withdraw money from their account, updating the account balance if the withdrawal amount is valid.
main():

The main function contains the user interface and menu for interacting with the banking system. It processes user choices and calls corresponding functions.
Usage
Compile the program using a C compiler.
Run the compiled executable.
Follow the on-screen menu to perform banking operations.
Limitations and Future Improvements
The program does not persist account data between program runs; a file-based approach could be implemented for data storage.
There is no password or authentication mechanism, making the program unsuitable for real-world use.
The program does not handle edge cases like invalid inputs extensively.
Conclusion
The Banking System Program provides a basic understanding of C programming concepts and serves as a starting point for more advanced banking system implementations. It can be enhanced with additional features and improvements based on specific project requirements.
